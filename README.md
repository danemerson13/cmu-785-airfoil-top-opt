# cmu-785-airfoil-top-opt

This is a course project for 19/24-785, Engineering Optimization, from the Fall 2020 semester at Carnegie Mellon.
Group members: Aaron Burns, Annette Guo, Daniel Emerson, and Kevin Dai

The code will conduct a topology optimization on a two dimensional airfoil quadrilateral mesh using the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm in MATLAB's fmincon function.
